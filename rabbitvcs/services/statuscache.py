    The actual status checks are done by a separate object, which should have
    a "check_status(self, path, recurse, summary)" method (see the specific
    classes for details).
    
    If a summary is requested, the return type/callback parameter will always be
    of the form:
        
        (non-recursive status dict, summarised recursive status dict)
    
    ...where both dicts are of the form:
    
        {path: {"text_status": text_status,
                "prop_status": prop_status}}

    All thread synchronisation should be taken care of BY THIS CLASS. Callers
    of public methods should not have to worry about synchronisation, except
    that callbacks may originate from a different thread (since this class is
    meant to be used in a separate process, that's probably not a big deal).
    
    Note about paths: here and there I've specified a "sane path". This class
    does not do robust path checking and normalisation, so basically what is
    meant is: this class expects absolute, normalised paths everywhere. This is
    what Nautilus gives us, it is what PySVN gives us, so unless you're
    hard-wiring something in, you should be fine.
    
    Note to developers: The major pitfall here is that the check_status needs to
    access the cache, and will therefore block while the cache is locked.
    Therefore, GREAT CARE must be taken to avoid locking the cache for longer
    than necessary.
