								  NautilusSvn
								  ===========

Introduction
------------

This program is an extension to the Nautilus file manager to allow better
integration with the Subversion source control system.

All files copyright 2006 Jason Field. All files licensed under the GNU GPL v2 -
see file COPYING.

The original source distribution can be found at http://jasonfield.com/freebies.

Requirements
------------

I've only tested this in Ubuntu Feisty, so the instructions are only for that OS.
Other operating systems should be essentially the same once the dependencies are
satisfied.

This software requires the following packages to be installed,

python-nautilus
python-wxgtk2.6
python-svn
meld (Optional - see 'Options' below.)

Everything else required should be installed by default. If not, let me know at
the address below!

Installation
------------

* Please note that there is an experimental .deb file available at
* http://jasonfield.com/freebies.

Nautilus extensions live in ~/.nautilus/python-extensions - make sure that this
directory exists.

mkdir ~/.nautilus/python-extensions/

Next up unpack the archive into ~/.nautilus/python-extensions/NautilusSvn

cd ~/.nautilus/python-extensions/
tar -xzf <PATH TO FILE>/NautilusSvn_v0.1.tar.gz NautilusSvn

Finally we need to set up a symlink so that Nautilus finds the correct startup
script. 

ln -s NautilusSvn/NautilusSvn.py NautilusSvn.py

Now just restart Nautilus (i.e. log out and back in again should do it), and you
should see the new Subversion menu items.

Options
-------

There are several user-definable switches in the file helper.py that change the
behaviour of the extension.

ENABLE_EMBLEMS - This turns on/off the rendering of status emblems oneach file
	icon in the file browser.

ENABLE_ATTRIBUTES - Adds revision and author columns to the list view in
	Nautilus.

DIFF_TOOL - Specifes which executable to use for diff operations. I've tried it
	with gvidiff, but I mostly use Meld since it's ace.

RECURSIVE_STATUS - If enabled, the file status check when drawing emblems will 
	use recursive checks. This is a bit experimental, as it might cause high
	CPU loads on large working copies.
