# If you didn't know already, this is a Python distutils setup script. It borrows
# heavily from Phatch's (see: http://photobatch.stani.be/).
#
# There's a lot of comments here (on purpose) so people can actually learn from
# this and don't have to figure out everything on their own.
#
# This setup script is used to build distribution specific packages.
#
# For more information see: http://docs.python.org/dist/dist.html
#

# TODO: this all feels just a little too shell scripty, refactoring it later 
# might be a good idea.

# NOTES:
# System-wide directories:
# NautilusSvn goes in: /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-<version>/python/
# Scalable emblems go in: /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/emblems
#
# User-specific directories:
# NautilusSvn goes in: ~/.nautilus/python-extensions/
# Scalable emblems go in: ~/.icons/hicolor/scalable
#
# Common directories
# See: http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html
# Configuration information goes in: ~/.config/nautilussvn/
# Data goes in: ~/.local/share/nautilussvn
